## Software PaCkage for Cell reseArch

This project is hosted by the [CFisUC](http://cfisuc.fis.uc.pt/) at the [University of Coimbra](www.uc.pt) 
and consists in a phase-field model for multicellular systems.

This software was developed to study how the mechanical constraints imposed by the extracellular matrix (ECM) affects cell migration. We explored a phase-field model that describes the fibres and the cell as order parameters that interact by repulsion and adhesion.
